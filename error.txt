Of course. I've analyzed your EditMeasurement.js code and the console errors. The issue is happening for a very common reason in React applications that use routing.

The Cause of the Error
The error Missing required parameters is happening because your useEffect hook is running before React Router has had a chance to provide the customerId and measurementId from the URL.

Here's the sequence of events:

Your component starts to render.

The useParams() hook is called, but it hasn't received the URL parameters yet. At this moment, customerId and measurementId are undefined.

Your useEffect hook runs because the component has rendered.

It checks if (customerId && measurementId), which is false.

It then hits your else block and logs the error: console.error('Missing required parameters:', { customerId, measurementId });.

A moment later, React Router provides the parameters, and the component re-renders. This time, the useEffect runs successfully.

This is why you see the error appear in the console multiple times right before the page loads correctly. It's a classic race condition.

The Solution
The solution is to add a "guard clause" at the very beginning of your useEffect to prevent it from running its logic until the parameters are ready. I have also identified and fixed a bug in your handleSubmit function where it wasn't correctly updating existing measurements.

Here is the corrected and improved version of your component.
